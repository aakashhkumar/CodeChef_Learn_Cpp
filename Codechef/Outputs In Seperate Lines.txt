We can use "<< endl" to have the next outputs be on the next line. It is like pressing the "Enter" / "Return" key on your keyboard, but for the output displayed.

Write a program which does the following

Output: 3 + 4
Output: 2 + 1 in a separate line using the given command.


Code : 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  cout << 3 + 4;
  cout << endl ;
  cout << 2 + 1;

  return 0;
}
