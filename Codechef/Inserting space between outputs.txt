If you want the output to be in the same line and have a space separate them,

We can use " " to act as an empty space in between multiple outputs.
We had seen previously that text has to be enclosed within brackets during cout ("text")
An empty space is a blank space between brackets (" ")

Write a program which does the following

Output the result of 3 + 4
Output the result of 2 + 1 on the same line separated by a space from the previous result

CODE : 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  cout << 3 + 4 << " " << 2 + 1;

  return 0;
}
